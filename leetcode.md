### Leetcode practices

#### Stacks

- [739: Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)
  This is a typical usage of monotone stack, refer to this [video(Chinese)](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/daily-temperatures/solution/leetcode-tu-jie-739mei-ri-wen-du-by-misterbooo/) or this [Medium post (English)](https://medium.com/@vishnuvardhan623/monotonic-stack-e9dcc4fa8c3e) for details

- [503: Next Greater Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)
  This is VERY similar to 739

- [394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)



#### Array
- [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/):
    Pay attention on the solution on this question, it's a typical solution for this kind of problems


#### Tree
- [144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)
- [94: Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)
- [145: Binary Tree postorder Traversal ](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)


### Sorting
#### Binary Sort
  - [153: find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
     two ways of solving this issue:
     - O(n): set a variable `min_val`, loop the array, and eventually get the min min_val
     - O(log n): using binary sort, this is a typical question to use binary sort, similar as question 154
  typical questions for Binary sorts are
  - 33
  - 34
  - 154

#### [Nation Flag issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem)
- [75 sort colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)
#### Merge Sort
- [148. Sort List](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)
